# react-native-picker-modal
A React Native Picker that mimics Android's implementation in iOS without changing the original API. It uses React Native's `Picker` on Android and `Text` that shows the `Picker` inside a `Modal` on iOS.

## Install
```sh
npm i react-native-picker-modal --save
// OR
yarn add react-native-picker-modal
```

## Usage
It receives and passes along the same props that the [react-native Picker](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/picker.html) receives.
